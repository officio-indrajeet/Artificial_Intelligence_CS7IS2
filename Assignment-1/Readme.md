# Maze Solver

This project implements and compares different algorithms for solving mazes, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A\* search, Value Iteration, and Policy Iteration.

## Usage

1. **Unzip the Folder**:

   - Unzip the folder `CS7IS2-AI-MAZE-SOLVER` and navigate to the `MazeSolver` directory.

2. **Run DFS Algorithm**:

   ```bash
   python3 DFS.py
   ```

   - After running the script, enter the choice of maze size when prompted. For example, entering `2` selects a 10x10 maze.

3. **Run BFS Algorithm**:

   ```bash
   python3 BFS.py
   ```

   - Follow similar steps as above to select the maze size.

4. **Run A\* Algorithm**:

   ```bash
   python3 aStar.py
   ```

   - Follow similar steps as above to select the maze size.

5. **Run Value Iteration Algorithm**:

   ```bash
   python3 ValueIteration.py
   ```

   - Follow similar steps as above to select the maze size.

6. **Run Policy Iteration Algorithm**:
   ```bash
   python3 PolicyIteration.py
   ```
   - Follow similar steps as above to select the maze size.
